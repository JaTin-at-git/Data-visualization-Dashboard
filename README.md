I have tried to construct filter queries using complex logical combinations. Typically, filters are connected using intersections or unions. However, my approach allows for the construction of more complex logical connections. <br>

For example, one can construct a query like ((Energy ∪ Manufacturing) ∩ (Environment ∪ Social)) to generate insights where the domain consists of risks belonging to the energy or manufacturing sectors that also have environmental or social impacts. <br>

Filtering data to this level of complexity is not feasible using traditional filtering methods. <br>
